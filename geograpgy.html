        <h1>Geographical Diversification of West Bengal</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. The Himalayan Region (North Bengal)</h2>
            <p>The northern part of West Bengal is dominated by the Eastern Himalayas. The Darjeeling hills and
                Kalimpong regions are known for their scenic mountains, tea gardens, and forests. The highest peak in
                the region is Sandakphu (3,636 meters). The Teesta River is a major river that flows through this
                region.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. The Terai and Dooars</h2>
            <p>Just below the Himalayas, the Terai and Dooars region is characterized by dense forests, grasslands, and
                tea plantations. This area is home to rich biodiversity and famous national parks like Jaldapara and
                Gorumara, where one can find Indian one-horned rhinoceroses and elephants.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. The Gangetic Plains (Central Bengal)</h2>
            <p>Central West Bengal consists of the fertile Gangetic plains, where rivers like the Ganges, Hooghly, and
                Damodar play a crucial role in agriculture. This region is densely populated and includes major cities
                like Kolkata, Bardhaman, and Murshidabad. The landscape is marked by floodplains, fertile alluvial soil,
                and wetlands.</p>

            <h2>4. The Western Plateau</h2>
            <p>The western part of the state, including districts like Purulia, Bankura, and West Midnapore, is part of
                the Chotanagpur Plateau. This area is known for its laterite soil, undulating hills, and rich mineral
                resources. The Ajodhya Hills and forests of this region support tribal communities and wildlife.</p>

            <h2>5. The Coastal and Sundarbans Region (South Bengal)</h2>
            <p>The southernmost part of West Bengal is home to the world's largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans. This
                region is shaped by the confluence of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers, forming a vast delta.
                The Sundarbans is famous for its unique ecosystem, home to the Royal Bengal Tiger and various marine
                species. The coastal belt of Digha and Mandarmani is known for its beaches and fishing activities.</p>
